# localization
基于CSI的工业互联网深度学习定位

WiFi-based indoor localization is a vital part of applications
that rely on the positions of terminals.In recent years, the learning-based
methods has shown their strong latent capacity of high reliability and
accuracy. However, they are more or less environment dependent since
the received data inevitably contain environment features that perhaps
interfere the learning process. A localization model trained by the data
collected in a specific and static environment does not work well if it is applied to predict the position in a new or varying situation. Slight changes
of physical environment may cause the learned model mismatch, leading
to large positioning errors.Thus, the paper focus on this challenge and
address the environment dependent problem of indoor localization. We
construct an adversarial network that can dissociate the target features
and environment features, where the position is obtained from target
features only. The proposed method is validated by experimental WiFi
data collected in different rooms or in the same room with changes. The
localization performance is independent to the environment.
